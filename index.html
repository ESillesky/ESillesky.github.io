    <p class="synopsis"><strong>Synopsis:</strong><br>
      eLC is an essential tool used by schools within the USG school system for posting assignments, grades, lecture slides/videos, and more. Often, students and professors resort to external platforms such as Piazza, GroupMe, Tophat, Discord, and Slack to utilize features and functionalities not available through eLC. This signifies eLC's lack in meeting the student's and professors' evolving needs. Additionally, using these external software gives the professors limited control of the conversation, which may lead to academic dishonesty, general confusion amongst students, or some students missing out on the conversation. Our plan of action to solve this is to integrate group/direct messaging features with a communication compliance policy, video/audio calls, and customizable discussion boards into eLC.Â </p>
