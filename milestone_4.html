        <h2>A. High-Fidelity Prototype</h2>
       
        <h3><b>User Story 01:</b></h3>
        <p>As a student, I would like to see my chat threads for each class organized on elc so that I can easily navigate to a specific group message or direct message.</p>
        <h3><b>Extended description:</b></h3>
        <p>To address our proposed problem that instructors and students tend to extensively resort to external platforms for the messaging capabilities, we decided to integrate group and direct messaging into eLC. Users can easily access the messaging feature through the nav bar to create a new message or go to the messaging hub to see chats. We ended up adding a search bar which will allow the student to quickly search up a classmate or group. This further helps our mission of ease of access and usability to allow students making groups and individual chats easy to interact with each other within the classroom and outside through eLC.

        <h3><b>Click-by-click description</b></h3>
        <p>As a student utilizing the eLC platform I want to start a group or direct message. First I will navigate to the eLC homepage and on the navbar, I will click on the “Messages” Icon. From there I get a drop with two options: “New Messages'' or “Existing Messages.” When I click on the ‘New messages'  Icon I get a pop-up prompting me to find the group or person to message. Here I can type the names of the student or instructor I want to message. When I click on the Existing messages icon then I am taken to a page with all previous conversations and from this page, I am also able to click on the “New Message Icon” to message a new student or I can also click on the “Messages” Icon the drop-down previously mentioned since the navbar is persistent on all the pages.</p>
        <br>
        <h3><b>User Story 02:</b></h3>
        <p>
            As an instructor, I would like the ability to check if the group and direct messaging content 
            violates the communication compliance policy.
        </p>
        <h3><b>Extended description:</b></h3>
        <p>Referencing back to our problem, students tend to unintentionally get into circumstances that violate academic honesty because the external group/direct messaging features do not integrate a chat monitoring system that would protect users from instances of academic dishonesty. Therefore, based on the Microsoft 365 Teams chat’s compliance communication policy, we decided to integrate a similar chat monitoring system into our implementation of group/direct messaging. This allows students to be a part of group chats without having to worry about other students jeopardizing the academic honesty of the group chat. 
            </p>

        <h3><b>Click-by-click description</b></h3>
        <p>The instructor gets a notification that a chat has been flagged and is ready to be reviewed. The instructor is going to click either the notification or the Communication Compliance tab. When the instructor clicks the notification they are taken to all messages that are pending review for that specific class. The instructor is given the option to ignore the message or report it. From this page, the instructor can click on management policies where the instructor is allowed to update the policy, by adding or deleting keywords. When the instructor clicks the tab, the instructor has options to investigate the message(s) in question, create a new policy for future messages, or update a policy already in place. </p>
        <br>
        <h3><b>User Story 03: </b></h3>
        <p>
            As a student, I would like the ability to learn more about communication compliance
            policy so that I can know my rights and its use to uphold academic honesty.
        </p>
        <h3><b>Extended description:</b></h3>
        <p>Referring back to the main issue addressed in user story two, to alleviate the chances of academic dishonesty happening on the elc’s messaging platforms, students can feel safer if we integrate a communication compliance policy into the group/direct messaging platforms. However, it is apparent that having a chat monitoring system that the user know nothing about might make the system intimidating and deter use. Therefore, just as the user - students at the University of Georgia have had before with lab guidelines and required Covid19 courses, it seems appropriate to include a compliance communication policy course for students. This way students are well informed about what the policy means and does before it is enabled for their system. The compliance communication policy course is mandatory in order for users to take part in group/direct messaging on eLC. The group/direct feature in eLC is only enabled once the student has taken the course and understood it, signified by a 100% on the quiz at the end of the course. Our design choices did not change much for this because the main purpose of this user story idea is to enforce this course as we believe the communication policy is to inform the student about the communication policy as a safety measure for the elc messaging feature to uphold the academic policy allowing students peace of mind as they partake in group chats for classes. So while we made the appearance look much better, our idea for this included features elc already has implemented, thus our design stays uniform to elc.

        <p>I am a student that is going to take the communication compliance policy course so I can enable the messaging feature so I am well informed about what the policy means and does. When I click on the course page on eLC, I have access to a video, a quiz, and a summary of why this course is important. To get to the video I will click on the ‘Policy video’ tab on the sidebar. This video will help all students get a better understanding and will prepare them for the mandatory quiz. After watching the video the student will click on the tab on the sidebar, ‘Module Quiz’. Each student will have an unlimited amount of chances to take the quiz but must get a 100 to enable messaging. Once the student has received a 100, a permanent notification pops up on the course home page, notifying them that the messaging feature has been enabled.

        <h3><b>User Story 04: </b></h3>
        <p>
            As a student, I would like to video or audio call my group through 
            elc so that I can easily communicate with them on an assignment.
        </p>
        <h3><b>Extended description:</b></h3>
        <p>Referencing back to our proposed problem, with our solutions we aim to decrease the degree to which students and professors resort to external platforms to access functionalities like group and direct messaging as well as video and audio calls. There are several potential advantages of video conferencing in education for example, content sharing, connecting students with their in-class peers, connecting participants, recording functionality, and interaction and collaboration with ease. Which proved very useful during the pandemic. Thus this user story is relevant to our solution since it allows students to use elc for all their needs with no need to access external video/audio call platforms.
            </p>

        <p>I am a student that wants to check their call log or to see if I missed a call. I will click on the ‘Audio/Video call’ tab on the nav bar and click ‘existing calls’ from the drop down and from there it will take me to a view of all my calls that I have made, if I have missed calls, or voicemails. I can directly call from there by searching or finding a previous call made, and click on the ‘video call’ icon. Or if I want to create a new call with one person or a group I will, again click the ‘Audio/Video call’ tab from the nav bar and click on ‘new call’ from the drop down. A pop up will show up that allows me to search for anyone that has an account with eLC UGA so I can quickly call one person or create a group call.</p>

        <h3><b>User Story 05: </b></h3>
        <p>
            As an instructor, I would like to customize a discussion board for my class so I can have a board that 
            is pertinent to my teaching style and the course.
        </p>
        <h3><b>Extended description:</b></h3>
        <p>Referencing back to our initial problem. Often professors resort to external platforms such as Piazza and TopHat in order to structure their course in a way that best fits their teaching style. As stated previously, the heavy reliance on these external platforms not only proposes potential issues of Academic Dishonesty, but also creates clutter due to the need to resort to multiple external platforms rather than just one, eLC. Incorporating the ability to customize discussion boards on eLC not only assists professors in getting their course content to students in a more efficient and desired manner but also increases convenience as this feature is readily available on eLC, minimizing the need to resort to external platforms. The design process for this feature was straightforwad since we had eLC to go off of, thus no big design decisions had to be made or changed. It relates to our problem of study because we are trying to make it look like eLC as much as possible and afford accessibility for instructors. Again, we thought having consistent design decisions with all the implementation would help us, help the user make less decisions for a more happy/convenient interaction with the system.

First I will Navigate to the desired course in which I want to start a new discussion or view an existing discussion. Now I find the Discussion Board dropdown. Here I am presented with two options; Create Discussion Board and Existing Discussion Boards. I will click on Existing Discussion Boards and here I can view all of the past discussions listed. Now, I want to start a new discussion board so I click on the Create Discussion board and here I'm prompted to enter the name of my new Discussion Board. Next, I am prompted with a quick questionnaire that includes questions such as “Type of class?” and “How often do I plan to assign discussions?” in order to help determine what kind of discussion board it will be.</p>

        <h2>B. Testing Protocol<br></h2>
        <h3><b>Research question: </b></h3>
        <p>Will the integration of additional functionalities/features into eLC help meet the evolving needs of instructors and students, thus limiting the need for external platforms?
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3><b>Methodology for Testing:</b></h3>
        <p>Our goal is to make eLC more adaptable to the evolving needs of students and professors. Ultimately, by kickstarting the integration of adaptable features this will allow students and instructors to use eLC extensively and for a variety of their needs without the need of third party platforms. As the initial initiative to alleviate this issue, our solution consists of integrating group/direct messaging features with a communication compliance policy, video/audio calls, and customizable discussion boards into eLC. 
             <br>
             <br>
             Therefore, once we begin user research, we will determine the metrics to track based on the proposed solution to meet this goal. Since the features mentioned will be integrated into eLC, students and professors will have no choice but to use them; therefore, engagement will not be a significant metric to consider. Instead, we will explore factors such as "user satisfaction" and "task completion rate," which are relevant to our goals because they speak directly to the effectiveness of our users' day-to-day work on eLC and their likelihood to continue using the platform.
             <br>
             <br>
             In addition, there are frameworks to help measure success in design and aid in the metric setting. In order to pick the proper metric setting framework for our problem. We will find what framework makes sense in the context of our research question and solution's impact on the user. 
Let's take a look at Google's HEART Framework, it was proposed in 2010 by the Google research team and applied widely in the company, aims at measuring user experience on a large scale with the following five categories: 
            <br>
            <li>Happiness: How do people feel about your product? (E.g., Use the survey to track Satisfaction and Ease of use)
            </li>
            <li>Engagement: How are people using your product? (E.g. # of 7-day active users, # users starts a new search per day)
            </li>
            <li>Adoption: New users (E.g. # of accounts created in the last 7 days)
            </li>
            <li>Retention: Existing users (E.g. % of users who use the feature again)
            </li>
            <li>Task Success: Complete actions (E.g. # of users who can accomplish a task) ” (​​Rodden 2015)
            </li>
            <br>
            This framework would be great once the features are integrated, and we can set up an analytical dashboard and compare user engagement metrics pre and post-launch. However, since we are not implementing our solution and only have a prototype, we will utilize System Usability Scale (SUS) to measure the Happiness category or "user-satisfaction rate." John Brooke developed the system Usability Scale; this system provides a "quick and dirty" way to assess the usability of a system. It includes ten items in a questionnaire, and users respond with a Likert scale (Strongly disagree to agree strongly) for each question
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>I think that I would like to use this system frequently. </li>
            <li>I think that I would like to use this system frequently. </li>
            <li>I thought the system was easy to use.</li>
            <li>I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this system.</li>
            <li>I found the various functions in this system were well integrated</li>
            <li>I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system.</li>
            <li>I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly.</li>
            <li>I found the system very cumbersome to use.</li>
            <li>I felt very confident using the system.</li>
            <li>I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system.</li>
            <br>
            Finally, this will produce a usability score for the features, which we can use to compare the experience before and after the features are integrated(​​Sauro 2011). 
The system usability scale evaluates the effectiveness of our design in solving our problem of study, more specifically it will help us learn:
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>Can our users navigate our product easily and without technical assistance? Are they satisfied with our product?</li>
            <li>Would our users become advocates for our product? Would they recommend it to a friend or colleague?</li>
            <li>Tap into trends in our results to weed out unusable features and make way for future improvements.</li>
            <li>Shape our product to user needs by creating custom solutions based on real, qualitative feedback.</li>
            <br>
            Ultimately, we will run a survey shaped around the reputable System Usability Scale framework to gauge our tool’s usability—then use feedback to fill in the gaps.(Maze)
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3><b>Testing Procedure </b></h3>
        <p>To implement testing and get user feedback we would utilize a software called Maze. The great thing about this software is that it acts like a catalyst in the product design process by making it possible to drive faster turnaround times, speeding up product iteration and making for a better, faster user experience. Maze will allow us to use a framework of our choice for the data collection. It also allows our data collection to include our prototype. For instance, it seamlessly imports prototypes from leading design platforms like Figma, InVision, Adobe XD, Marvel, and Sketch and accelerates our process from idea to test. We would use Maze utilizing the SUS framework. Through this app, a student is able to complete pre-determined missions on the app for instance “Start a group message ” or an instructor will complete a mission like “Customize a discussion board”. The app allows them to complete the specific task then ask them to rate their experience with a likert scale (1= disagree, 5 or 6 = neutral and 10 = agree) asking question such as:
            <li>I think that I would like to use this [Feature] frequently.</li>
            <li>I found the [Feature] unnecessarily complex.</li>
            <li>I thought the [Feature] was easy to use.            </li>
            <li>I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use [Feature]. </li>
            <li>I found the various functions in this [Feature] were well integrated.</li>
            <li>I thought there was too much inconsistency in this [Feature].            </li>
            <br>
            <P>As you can tell from the types of questions asked, the responses will help us understand, how useful this new feature is for our users, if its too complex for the average user thus needs to be simplified, whether the integration into eLC is seemless and whether there are any inconsistencies that dont meet the goal.</P>
            <br>
            To deal with informed consent, before each user testing we will make sure users fill out a consent form informing them about the study, how the results will be used, how it impacts them. We will also make sure anyone with any issues prohibiting them from making an informed consent are given the necessary tools to give an informed consent. 
            <br>
            <br>
            As mentioned above we will be collecting user feedback using a software tool called maze. A feature that was appealing in picking Maze for the data collection and organization, is that it reduces hours of analysis by presenting test results in the metrics that matter, so findings are easy to come by and even easier to share. It also instantly turns our test results into quantitative data, from bounce rates and misclicks to heatmaps; eliminating hours spent watching recorded, moderated sessions. Once the data is collected we can also quickly customize the way we see our data with the rich filters that help discover valuable insights, faster. Results automatically generate a visually dynamic report that communicates key insights in no time with a unique usability score and customizable components. Based on these results we will be able to answer the question whether the integration of additional functionalities/features into eLC help meet the evolving needs of instructors and students, thus limiting the need for external platforms? 
            <br>
            Maze allows us to format our results in a dynamic report that communicates key insights. Therefore, the maze software will take away the guessing game from result analysis by categorizing, classifying, and organizing the data gathered to directly inform us about what we’ll share as outcomes of the research and the key findings. Lastly, once we receive the results we will focus on meeting to discuss the obtained results and examining the reports to determine what needs improvements, evaluate whether futuritis esists within our designs.
            <br>
            <br>
            This testing will be conducted online through the maze platfom, therefore during a pandemic the the same testing procedure will be held. Our main users for the platform are students and instructor therefore to get the students to participate we will send an email to all students through the student liserv informing them about the study, contact information if they are interested in participating as well information to about who to contact incase of concers pertaining to the ethics of the study. We will also provide an incentive to make sure we get many students participating so that we can collect a representative data. As for the professors, since this is a useful tool for them and their students, an email to all the instructors about the usefulness of these feature integrations will motivate instructors to participate in the study.
