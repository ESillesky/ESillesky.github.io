        <h3><b>User Story 01:</b></h3>
        <p>As a student, I would like to see my chat threads for each class organized on elc so that I can easily navigate to a specific group message or direct message.</p>
        <h3><b>Extended description:</b></h3>
        <p>To address our proposed problem that instructors and students tend to extensively resort to external platforms for the messaging capabilities, we decided to integrate group and direct messaging into eLC. Users can easily access the messaging feature through the nav bar to create a new message or go to the messaging hub to see chats. We ended up adding a search bar which will allow the student to quickly search up a classmate or group. This further helps our mission of ease of access and usability to allow students making groups and individual chats easy to interact with each other within the classroom and outside through eLC.

        <p>As a student utilizing the eLC platform I want to start a group or direct message. First I will navigate to the eLC homepage and on the navbar, I will click on the “Messages” Icon. From there I get a drop with two options: “New Messages'' or “Existing Messages.” When I click on the ‘New messages'  Icon I get a pop-up prompting me to find the group or person to message. Here I can type the names of the student or instructor I want to message. When I click on the Existing messages icon then I am taken to a page with all previous conversations and from this page, I am also able to click on the “New Message Icon” to message a new student or I can also click on the “Messages” Icon the drop-down previously mentioned since the navbar is persistent on all the pages.</p>

            As discussed previously, alot of instances of academic dishonesty as they pertain to external platforms 
            are reported. Especially as it deals with messaging platforms such as groupme, we not only want to 
            incorporate a messaging platform into eLC but we also want to mitigate and prevent academic dishonesty
             that messaging platforms can sometimes enable. For instance during the pandemic because of the increased
              reliance on social media and the lack on integration we saw a surge in academic dishonesty as it relates
               to social media platforms,  in an article warning Georgia State university about cheating through groupme
                author Jones says "This semester, students relied on GroupMe more than ever due to most classes being 
                online. The app's increased use led to more cheating scandals and inappropriate messages circulating 
                in an environment meant to be educational." Thus with our suggested solution of incorporating a messaging 
                platform with the communication compliance policy addition, will help students feel certain and safe.<br>
                We decided that incorporating the communication compliance policy from Microsoft office would be the best, after
                 extensively researching the plethora of chat monitoring systems out there. Microsoft 365 uses a Communication Compliance Policy
                  and says , "Communication compliance helps minimize communication risks by helping you detect, capture, and act on inappropriate
                   messages in your organization." Having a policy like this incorporated into the messaging platform would prevent and minimize problems
                    like academic dishonesty. <br>
                    We think this is the best solution since it's used within Microsoft teams and offers admins the opportunity to monitor the interactions 
                    in a non-invasive way in terms of privacy.

            As a student, I would like the ability to learn more about communication compliance
            policy so that I can know my rights and its use to uphold academic honesty.

            The communication policy is a safety measure for the elc messaging feature to uphold the academic 
            policy allowing students peace of mind as they partake in group chats for classes. Like we have 
            talked about in Milestone 1 and 2, with external platforms like groupMe or whatsApp, students can 
            often find themselves in trouble for violating academic honesty sometimes for situations they had 
            no hand in. Thus implementing the communication compliance policy mitigates the problem at hand 
            and making sure the students are as informed about the Communication Compliance Policy that is
             upheld through the messaging platform within elc, will allow them to understand what it is before
              it is enforced. A column from GaleOnefile wrote, "Unstandardized policy leads to student confusion 
              and frustration as students try to understand the different ways professors view collaboration on
               GroupMe and other messaging platforms. The more involved professors are in determining their policy, 
               the more secure students will feel." Having a mandatory course that students can access at all times 
               and must take at least once, will decrease confusion and frustration about the policy. This will also
                make students feel like they are not being monitored in an invasive way since they will understand
                 exactly what the policy is and does.<br> In the article by Jones, she interviews Dr. Michael 
                 Sanseviro, Georgia State’s Dean of Students who says "GroupMe cases can be very complex to 
                 know for sure who was involved in what specific violations when so many students have access, 
                 which is why the university tries to educate students about the standards of academic integrity and the 
                 potential consequences," thus having a course that keeps students informed about what's happening behind
                  the hood for the chats will help them build trust in the platform. Thus addressing our solution of why it's important
                   to implement communication compliance into the elc messaging feature

        <p>
            As a student, I would like to video or audio call my group through 
            elc so that I can easily communicate with them on an assignment.

            Going back to our initial problem, students and professors resort to external platforms to access
             functionalities like group and direct messaging as well as video and audio calls. Over the past few 
             years we have seen how much companies such as Zoom and Cisco webex have benefited. While it's great
              that they get alot of market from students, let's ask ourselves at what expense on the students' part.
               It's never convenient having to access your scheduled zoom calls through zoom. I asked a fellow 
               student what her day to day process is when attending a scheduled zoom call, first she said she has 
               found a link to the meeting, there are no reminders unless you link zoom to your calendar so students
                sometimes end up forgetting. Once you have a meeting ID or link you then join the meeting. The frustration with Zoom 
                is a pretty consistent one among students. However, if video/Audio calls were to be integrated into eLC at least for 
                higher education use. A student would get reminders, whenever there is a meeting they need to attend and they can join 
                right from the elc tab or even invite classmates by finding them by name. They will also have video/audio calls related to school organized in one place. 
                <br>In an article discussing the 'importance of video conferencing in education', the authors at MacCormac College says 
                "There are various technologies instructors can use — from simply pre-recording or live streaming their lessons to interactive video conferencing 
                software. There are several potential advantages of video conferencing in education" including but not limited to Content sharing, 
                connecting students with their in-class peers, Connecting participants, Recording functionality, Engage others, Interaction and 
                collaboration with ease. Thus this user story is relevant to our solution since it allows students to use elc for all 
                their needs with no need to access external video/audio call platforms.

            As an instructor, I would like to customize a discussion board for my class so I can have a board that 
            is pertinent to my teaching style and the course.
        </p>
        <h3><b>Extended description::</b></h3>

            Discussion boards are an effective way to promote not only student to student interaction, 
            but also student/teacher interaction, and overall engagement. Initially we understood that 
            professors tend to resort to external discussion platforms such as Top Hat and Piazza because 
            they each offer different facets to hold discussions in-class. Thus our solution came into play. 
            We wanted to offer professors the flexibility of customizing discussion boards based on the purpose
             the discussion board is meant to serve. If professors can for instance generate multiple discussion boards 
             for a class based on the purpose they wouldn't have to resort to external platforms. 
            Let's explore the logo generating questionnaire utilized by wix. When a user decides to generate 
            a logo, a set of questions are asked to get a sense of how the user wants the logo to look, make the audience feel and the purpose its supposed to serve. After completing the questionnaire a set of logo's are generated on wix so that the user can pick the one that serves their purpose the best.(Wix Support) WIX uses questionnaires to generate something custom for their user, the same idea can be applied to generating a custom discussion board for instructors. This way they can have a discussion board that fits their teaching style and content type making the process efficient/convenient thus limiting the professors from resorting to external platforms.

        <h2>B. Testing Protocol<br></h2>
        <p>For each of the relevant user stories above we identified and justified 
            in (A), we generated numerous ideas for alternative design solutions that could
             be used to tell that story, and then we picked and described our top two for that
              story. We used Google Docs for our ideations, as it was the best way for us to 
              organize all of our user stories and ideas in a concise manner. <br>Our ideation 
              process for this part consisted of generating ideas together for each relevant
               user story then we highlighted the second best ideas for each user story in green, 
               and in yellow our top idea.
