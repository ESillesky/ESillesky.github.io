        <h2>A. High-Fidelity Prototype</h2>
       
        <h3><b>User Story 01:</b></h3>
        <p>As a student, I would like to see my chat threads for each class organized on elc so that I can easily navigate to a specific group message or direct message.</p>
        <h3><b>Extended description:</b></h3>
        <p>To address our proposed problem that instructors and students tend to extensively resort to external platforms for the messaging capabilities, we decided to integrate group and direct messaging into eLC. Users can easily access the messaging feature through the nav bar to create a new message or go to the messaging hub to see chats. We ended up adding a search bar which will allow the student to quickly search up a classmate or group. This further helps our mission of ease of access and usability to allow students making groups and individual chats easy to interact with each other within the classroom and outside through eLC.

        <p>As a student utilizing the eLC platform I want to start a group or direct message. First I will navigate to the eLC homepage and on the navbar, I will click on the “Messages” Icon. From there I get a drop with two options: “New Messages'' or “Existing Messages.” When I click on the ‘New messages'  Icon I get a pop-up prompting me to find the group or person to message. Here I can type the names of the student or instructor I want to message. When I click on the Existing messages icon then I am taken to a page with all previous conversations and from this page, I am also able to click on the “New Message Icon” to message a new student or I can also click on the “Messages” Icon the drop-down previously mentioned since the navbar is persistent on all the pages.</p>

            violates the communication compliance policy.

        <h2>B. Testing Protocol<br></h2>
        <p>For each of the relevant user stories above we identified and justified 
            in (A), we generated numerous ideas for alternative design solutions that could
             be used to tell that story, and then we picked and described our top two for that
              story. We used Google Docs for our ideations, as it was the best way for us to 
              organize all of our user stories and ideas in a concise manner. <br>Our ideation 
              process for this part consisted of generating ideas together for each relevant
               user story then we highlighted the second best ideas for each user story in green, 
               and in yellow our top idea.
