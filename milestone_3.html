    <h1>Milestone 3: Design Alternatives</h1>
    </head>

    <body>
        <h3>A. User Experience Requirements</h3>
        <p>
            We decomposed our proposed solutions from milestone 2 and turned them into user stories. 
            We organized them into a hierarchy of three activities: 
            <b>Group and Direct Messaging, Video and Audio Calls, and Customizable Discussion Board.</b>
        </p>
        <h3><b>Relevant User Stories:</b></h3>
        <h3><b>User Story 01: </b></h3>
        <p>
            As a student, I would like to see my chat threads for each class organized 
            on elc so that I can easily navigate to a specific group message or direct message.
        </p>
        <h3><b>Justifications:</b></h3>
        <p>
            Based on GroupMe, as soon as the user opens the app, 
            the landing page is where the user can see their existing group chats and direct messages 
            along with the option to start new ones. 
            This affords the user to easily choose which chat they want to get to.
        </p>

        <h3><b>User Story 02: </b></h3>
        <p>
            As a teacher, I would like the ability to check
         if the group and direct messaging content violates the communication compliance policy.
        </p>
        <h3><b>Justifications:</b></h3>
        <p>
            In milestone 2, we wanted to not only incorporate a messaging platform into eLC but we also
             wanted to mitigate and prevent academic honesty that messaging platforms can sometimes enable. 
             Microsoft 365 uses a Communication Compliance Policy and says , “ Communication compliance helps 
             minimize communication risks by helping you detect, capture, and act on inappropriate messages in 
             your organization.” Having a policy like this incorporated into the messaging platform would 
             prevent and minimize problems like academic hones
        </p>
        <h3><b>User Story 03: </b></h3>
        <p>
            As a student, I would like the ability to learn more about communication compliance policy so that
             I can know my rights and its use to uphold academic honest
        </p>
        <h3><b>Justifications:</b></h3>
        <p>
            Like we have talked about in Milestone 1 and 2, with external platforms like groupMe or whatsApp, 
            students can often find themselves in trouble with violating academic honesty. This is why we think
             making sure the students are as informed as they can be on the Communication Compliance Policy is so
              important. A column from GaleOnefile wrote, “Unstandardized policy leads to student confusion and 
              frustration as students try to understand the different ways professors view collaboration on 
              GroupMe and other messaging platforms.The more involved professors are in determining their policy, 
              the more secure students will feel.” Having a mandatory course that students can access at all times
               and must take at least once, will decrease confusion and frustration. 

        </p>
        <h3><b>User Story 04: </b></h3>
        <p>
            As a student and as an instructor, I would like the ability to change my call availability status as 
            needed and have it visible to other student
        </p>
        <h3><b>Justifications:</b></h3>
        <p>
            Having a feature that displays a user’s availability will clearly signify to other users whether or not a user is available 
            to make and/or receive calls from them at that time.

        </p>

        <h3><b>User Story 05: </b></h3>
        <p>
            As an instructor, I would like to navigate to the discussion so that I can start the
             process for creating a customizable discussion board.

        </p>
        <h3><b>Justifications:</b></h3>
        <p>
            Discussion boards are an effective way to promote not only student to student interaction, but
             also student/teacher interaction, and overall engagement in gener 

        </p>

        <h3><b>User Story 06: </b></h3>
        <p>
            As an instructor, I would like to customize a discussion board for my class so I can have a board
             that is pertinent to my teaching style and the course.
        </p>
        <h3><b>Justifications:</b></h3>
        <p>
             

        </p>

        <h3><b>User Story 07: </b></h3>
        <p>
            As a student, I would like the ability to favorite or bookmark entire discussions, follow up discussions,
             and/or comments on discussions so that I can easily return to prior discussi
        </p>
        <h3><b>Justifications:</b></h3>
        <p>
            Many times, there is an overflow of content on discussion boards, and not all of the 
            information is pertinent. The ability to filter out only desired information from numerous 
            discussion boards promotes organized and focused studying because students can easily go back to
             prior important discussions or comments, without having to sort through all of the content of 
             numerous discussion boards.

        <h3>B. Ideation and Prelimenary Designs<br></h3>
        <p>
            We used Google Docs for our ideations, as it was the best way for us to organize all of our 
            user stories and ideas. Highlighted are our best ideas for each user story, and in yellow is 
            our top idea.
        </p>

        <img src="EPIC 01.png" style="width: 500"/>

        <p><b>Top ideas:<br></b>
        <li>While on elc's homepage, the user can navigate to the group and direct messages from the "Messages" 
            Icon on the navigation bar. This allows them to access existing conversations or start new ones from 
            the "Start Conversation" option.</li>
        <li>While on elc's homepage, the user gets a pop-up asking if they would like to see the conversations 
            they've missed. If they click on "yes" this will bring them to where they can view the existing chats 
            or start new ones.</li>
        </p>

        <img src="EPIC 02.png" style="width: 500"/>

        <p><b>Top ideas:<br></b>
        <li>While on eLC, the teacher receives a notification that a group chat has been flagged. The 
            teacher clicks on the notification and is taken to the "messaging" page, where the specific 
            group and the message that was flagged is displayed for the teacher to review</li>
        <li>While on eLC's homepage the teacher clicks on the "messages" link, and is taken to the chats of 
            the specific class they are under. Where they can check if any messages with chats have been 
            flagged.</li>
        </p>

        <img src="EPIC 03.png" style="width: 500"/>

        <p><b>Top ideas:<br></b>
        <li>While on elc's homepage, students have a course dedicated to communication compliance, hereafter watching
             a video that explains the importance of communication compliance, the students will be prompted to take
              a quiz to verify policy understanding in students. Chat feature will not be enabled until students explicitly
               read and accept the communication compliance policy.</li>
        <li>While on elc's homepage, the student receives a notification to complete the communication compliance course. 
            The student clicks the notification bell icon, to navigate to the course. From there, they must watch a video
             and are then prompted to take a quiz to verify policy understanding. The chat feature is not enabled until
              the course is complete</li>
        </p>

        <img src="EPIC 04.png" style="width: 500"/>

        <p><b>Top ideas:<br></b>
        <li>While on elc's homepage, when the user clicks the "Messages" icon on the navigation bar, the user is brought 
            to the page consisting of the chat threads. Here the user can click on a conversation. Once a specific conversation
             pops up, on the sidebar they are given the option to start video/audio calls in that specific chat.</li>
        <li>While on elc's homepage, the user can access the video/Audio class page by clicking on the "Video/Audio calls" in the
             navigation bar. Once on the "Video/Audio calls" page. The user can see previous calls and can also click on "Call", where 
             they will be directed to a pop-up to find a group so that they can start a group call with or call a specific person.</li>
        </p>

        <img src="EPIC 05.png" style="width: 500"/>

        <p><b>Top ideas:<br></b>
        <li>While on elc's homepage, the user will navigate to a chat and click on the icon option that accurately reflects their availability... 
            Red: unavailable Green: available.</li>
        <li>While on elc's homepage, the user will navigate to the chat and completely disable all chat/call notifications when I am unavailable. 
            Calls and chats cannot be receieved.</li>
        </p>

        <img src="EPIC 06.png" style="width: 500"/>

        <p><b>Top ideas:<br></b>
        <li>While on elc's homepage, an instructor can click on a particular course once the instructor clicks on "Create Discussion Board" the
             instructor is directed to a questionnaire, and based on the instructor's response a discussion board is configured so that I can have
              a board that is pertinent to my teaching style and the course.</li>
        <li>While on elc's homepage, after clicking on a particular course, an instructor can click the "discussions" on the navbar. This prompts the 
            instructor with a drop-down of two options: create a discussion board or go to an existing one. By clicking "Create Discussion Board" the
             instructor is sent to a new page with options to customize so that I can have a board that is pertinent to my teaching style and the course. 
             By clicking "Existing Discussion Board" the instructor is given a list of all discussion boards organized by each class.
