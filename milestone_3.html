    <h1>Milestone 3: Design Alternatives</h1>
    </head>

    <body>
        <h3>A. User Experience Requirements</h3>
        <p>
            Initially, we had a problem at hand, why do professors and students resort to external platforms, despite the disadvantages and the uncertainty that comes with it? 
            Thus, our solution came into play: what if we were to offer students and professors all the benefits of using external platforms without the uncertainty and confusion. 
            Therefor, our solution is to integrate group/direct messaging features with a communication compliance policy, video/audio calls, and customizable discussion boards into eLC.
        </p>
            <br>
        <p>
            We decomposed our proposed solutions from milestone 2 and turned them into user stories. 
            We organized them into a hierarchy of three activities: 
            <b>Group and Direct Messaging, Video and Audio Calls, and Customizable Discussion Board.</b>
        </p>
        <h3><b>Group and Direct Messaging with a Communication Compliance Policy</b></h3>
        <li>As a student, I would like to see my chat threads for each class organized on elc so that I can easily navigate to a specific group message or direct message.</li>
        <li>As an instructor, I would like the ability to check if the group and direct messaging content violate the communication compliance policy.</li>
        <li>As a student, I would like the ability to learn more about communication compliance policy so that I can know my rights and it’s used to uphold academic honesty. </li>

        <h3><b>Video and Audio Calls</b></h3>
        <li>As a student, I would like to video or audio call my group through elc so that I can easily communicate with them on an assignment.</li>
        <li>As a student and as an instructor, I would like the ability to change my call availability status as needed and have it visible to other students. </li>

        <h3><b>Customizable Discussion Board</b></h3>
        <li>As an instructor, I would like to navigate to the discussion so that I can start the process for choosing a template for my customized discussion board.</li>
        <li>As a student, I would like to navigate to a discussion board for my class so that I can participate in assignments.</li>
        <li>As an instructor, I would like to customize a discussion board for my class so I can have a board that is pertinent to my teaching style and the course </li>

        <br>

        <h3><b>Relevant User Stories and Justifications </b></h3>
        <h3><b>User Story 01:</b></h3>
        <p>As a student, I would like to see my chat threads for each class organized on elc so that I can easily navigate to a specific group message or direct message.</p>
        <h3><b>Justifications:</b></h3>
        <p>We choose this user story as one of the most relevant since it directly relates to our initial problem, "Why are instructors and students resorting to external platforms despite
             uncertainty and confusion it causes in students." In a literary article by Chugh et al, They research and review "Social media usage by higher education academics" while reading
              the report the section dealing with the 'challenges and barriers of using social media' in higher education particularly stood out. As we have discussed, students can attest to 
              the confusion and also uncertainty that comes with using external platforms for school work. Similarly Chugh et al, mention, "Donelan (2016) found that the main barriers offered
               by academics for not using social media included lack of time (time to learn and use social media); lack of confidence, ability and skills; lack of interest; and negative perceptions
                (particularly with regard to the use of Twitter and blogs) in terms of the usefulness of social media to complement learning and teaching. More recently, Sapkota and Vander Putten’s 
                (2018) study on social media in learning and teaching established that although academics accepted the importance of social media as a tool to use in business, they could not agree on its
                 inclusion in the curriculum." This literary review showcases the uncertainty that external platforms(social media) cause among the other issues that it entails.
            We have also taken a look at previous cases where students utilizing external group direct messaging were caught in instances of academic dishonesty due to other students in the chat oversharing 
            assignment information. In an article by The Signal, they warn students about academic dishonesty at Georgia State, they start off by mentioning why students use group me in the first place "Apps
             like GroupMe could help students keep in touch with their classmates outside of the classroom, reminding each other of upcoming assignments and what happened in class if they are absent from class."(Jones 2021).  
            This user story is relevant since it addresses our proposed solution of integrating group/direct messaging capabilities to address our root problem. Thus integrating this feature in addition to a communication
             compliance policy to elc, would  immensely help students feel less confused and also foster a platform that embodies academic honesty.
            </p>
        <br>
        <h3><b>User Story 02:</b></h3>
        <p>
            As an instructor, I would like the ability to check if the group and direct messaging content 
            violates the communication compliance policy.
        </p>
        <h3><b>Justifications:</b></h3>
        <p>
            As discussed previously, alot of instances of academic dishonesty as they pertain to external platforms 
            are reported. Especially as it deals with messaging platforms such as groupme, we not only want to 
            incorporate a messaging platform into eLC but we also want to mitigate and prevent academic dishonesty
             that messaging platforms can sometimes enable. For instance during the pandemic because of the increased
              reliance on social media and the lack on integration we saw a surge in academic dishonesty as it relates
               to social media platforms,  in an article warning Georgia State university about cheating through groupme
                author Jones says "This semester, students relied on GroupMe more than ever due to most classes being 
                online. The app's increased use led to more cheating scandals and inappropriate messages circulating 
                in an environment meant to be educational." Thus with our suggested solution of incorporating a messaging 
                platform with the communication compliance policy addition, will help students feel certain and safe.<br>
                We decided that incorporating the communication compliance policy from Microsoft office would be the best, after
                 extensively researching the plethora of chat monitoring systems out there. Microsoft 365 uses a Communication Compliance Policy
                  and says , "Communication compliance helps minimize communication risks by helping you detect, capture, and act on inappropriate
                   messages in your organization." Having a policy like this incorporated into the messaging platform would prevent and minimize problems
                    like academic dishonesty. <br>
                    We think this is the best solution since it's used within Microsoft teams and offers admins the opportunity to monitor the interactions 
                    in a non-invasive way in terms of privacy.
                </p>

        <br>
        <h3><b>User Story 03: </b></h3>
        <p>
            As a student, I would like the ability to learn more about communication compliance
            policy so that I can know my rights and its use to uphold academic honesty.



        </p>
        <h3><b>Justifications:</b></h3>
        <p>
            The communication policy is a safety measure for the elc messaging feature to uphold the academic 
            policy allowing students peace of mind as they partake in group chats for classes. Like we have 
            talked about in Milestone 1 and 2, with external platforms like groupMe or whatsApp, students can 
            often find themselves in trouble for violating academic honesty sometimes for situations they had 
            no hand in. Thus implementing the communication compliance policy mitigates the problem at hand 
            and making sure the students are as informed about the Communication Compliance Policy that is
             upheld through the messaging platform within elc, will allow them to understand what it is before
              it is enforced. A column from GaleOnefile wrote, "Unstandardized policy leads to student confusion 
              and frustration as students try to understand the different ways professors view collaboration on
               GroupMe and other messaging platforms. The more involved professors are in determining their policy, 
               the more secure students will feel." Having a mandatory course that students can access at all times 
               and must take at least once, will decrease confusion and frustration about the policy. This will also
                make students feel like they are not being monitored in an invasive way since they will understand
                 exactly what the policy is and does.<br> In the article by Jones, she interviews Dr. Michael 
                 Sanseviro, Georgia State’s Dean of Students who says "GroupMe cases can be very complex to 
                 know for sure who was involved in what specific violations when so many students have access, 
                 which is why the university tries to educate students about the standards of academic integrity and the 
                 potential consequences," thus having a course that keeps students informed about what's happening behind
                  the hood for the chats will help them build trust in the platform. Thus addressing our solution of why it's important
                   to implement communication compliance into the elc messaging feature

        <h3><b>User Story 04: </b></h3>
        <p>
            As a student, I would like to video or audio call my group through 
            elc so that I can easily communicate with them on an assignment.

        </p>
        <h3><b>Justifications:</b></h3>
        <p>
            Going back to our initial problem, students and professors resort to external platforms to access
             functionalities like group and direct messaging as well as video and audio calls. Over the past few 
             years we have seen how much companies such as Zoom and Cisco webex have benefited. While it's great
              that they get alot of market from students, let's ask ourselves at what expense on the students' part.
               It's never convenient having to access your scheduled zoom calls through zoom. I asked a fellow 
               student what her day to day process is when attending a scheduled zoom call, first she said she has 
               found a link to the meeting, there are no reminders unless you link zoom to your calendar so students
                sometimes end up forgetting. Once you have a meeting ID or link you then join the meeting. The frustration with Zoom 
                is a pretty consistent one among students. However, if video/Audio calls were to be integrated into eLC at least for 
                higher education use. A student would get reminders, whenever there is a meeting they need to attend and they can join 
                right from the elc tab or even invite classmates by finding them by name. They will also have video/audio calls related to school organized in one place. 
                <br>In an article discussing the 'importance of video conferencing in education', the authors at MacCormac College says 
                "There are various technologies instructors can use — from simply pre-recording or live streaming their lessons to interactive video conferencing 
                software. There are several potential advantages of video conferencing in education" including but not limited to Content sharing, 
                connecting students with their in-class peers, Connecting participants, Recording functionality, Engage others, Interaction and 
                collaboration with ease. Thus this user story is relevant to our solution since it allows students to use elc for all 
                their needs with no need to access external video/audio call platforms.

        <h3><b>User Story 05: </b></h3>
        <p>
            As an instructor, I would like to customize a discussion board for my class so I can have a board that 
            is pertinent to my teaching style and the course.
        </p>
        <h3><b>Justifications:</b></h3>
        <p>
            Discussion boards are an effective way to promote not only student to student interaction, 
            but also student/teacher interaction, and overall engagement. Initially we understood that 
            professors tend to resort to external discussion platforms such as Top Hat and Piazza because 
            they each offer different facets to hold discussions in-class. Thus our solution came into play. 
            We wanted to offer professors the flexibility of customizing discussion boards based on the purpose
             the discussion board is meant to serve. If professors can for instance generate multiple discussion boards 
             for a class based on the purpose they wouldn't have to resort to external platforms. 
            Let's explore the logo generating questionnaire utilized by wix. When a user decides to generate 
            a logo, a set of questions are asked to get a sense of how the user wants the logo to look, make the audience feel and the purpose its supposed to serve. After completing the questionnaire a set of logo's are generated on wix so that the user can pick the one that serves their purpose the best.(Wix Support) WIX uses questionnaires to generate something custom for their user, the same idea can be applied to generating a custom discussion board for instructors. This way they can have a discussion board that fits their teaching style and content type making the process efficient/convenient thus limiting the professors from resorting to external platforms.

                or start new ones.</li>

        <p><b>Description</b></p>
        <p>We decided to go with this one as our top idea because we believe that the 
            navigation bar is the best design for students to get to their messages. 
            Having the navigation bar allows for students to have easy access to their 
            messages for each course. A paper on the usability of a navigation bar says,
             "Menus are the main form of navigation in web pages and should be designed to 
             allow intuitive, efficient and effective navigation, according to the user's 
             perception and to encourage the exploration of the site." Having a "Messaging" 
             link in our navigation makes finding their messages easy and systematic.

                  page, where the specific group and the message that was flagged is displayed for

             ideas in general, we came up with different ideas on how to navigate to it. 
             Like we have stated in our justifications, we want the students to be as informed 
             as possible on this so that they feel comfortable with the policy and up to date.

        <p><b>Second Best Idea</b></p>
            <li>While on elc's homepage, when the user clicks the "Messages" icon on 
                the navigation bar, the user is brought to the page consisting of the 
                chat threads. Here the user can click on a conversation. Once a specific 
                conversation pops up, on the sidebar they are given the option to start 
                video/audio calls in that specific chat.  </li>

        <p><b>Description</b></p>
        <p>We went with this idea asour top idea because a separate video/audio call link
             in the navigation bar effectively signifies that video/audio calls are a feature 
             from the home page itself, in contrast to our second best idea. In our second 
             best idea, the student is only aware of this feature once they are under a specific chat.

        <h3><b>User Story 05:</b></h3>
        <p>As an instructor, I would like to customize a discussion board for my class so I can have a board that is pertinent to my teaching style and the course.
        </p>
        <img src="EPIC 08.png" style="width: 500"/>

        <p><b>Top ideas:<br></b>
            <li>While on elc's homepage, an instructor can click on a particular course once the
                 instructor clicks on "Create Discussion Board" the instructor is directed to a
                  questionnaire, and based on the instructor's response a discussion board is configured 
                  so that I can have a board that is pertinent to my teaching style and the course 

            </li>

        <p><b>Second Best Idea</b></p>
            <li>While on the eLC's homepage, after clicking on a particular course,
                 an instructor can click the "discussions" on the navbar. This prompts the 
                 instructor with a drop-down of two options: create a discussion board or go
                  to an existing one. By clicking "Create Discussion Board" the instructor 
                  is sent to a new page with options to customize so that I can have a 
                  board that is pertinent to my teaching style and the course. By clicking 
                  "Existing Discussion Board" the instructor is given a list of all
                   discussion boards organized by each class.  </li>
            
        <p>Low-Fidelity design:</p>

        <p><b>Description</b></p>
        <p>We chose this design as our top idea because the instructor is immediately 
            presented with the option to create a new discussion board and questionnaire
             unlike our second best idea which first requires the instructor to pick a 
             specific class and only then is presented with the existing discussions and 
             create a new discussion questionnaire.

        <h3>C. Detailed Designs: Best Design Alternatvie fo each Relevant User Story</h3>
        <br>
        <h3><b>User Story 01:</b></h3>
        <p>As a student, I would like to see my chat threads for each class organized on elc so that I can easily navigate to a specific group message or direct message.</p>
        <h3><b>Best design alternative:</b></h3>
        <p>While on elc's homepage, the user can navigate to the group and direct messages from the "Messages" Icon on the navigation bar. This allows them to access existing conversations or start new ones from the "Start Conversation" option.
        </p>

        <h3><b>Detailed Figma Design:</b></h3>
        <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FyNbcjAKKP0fvTmoBu5srGN%2FHCI-Milestone-3-Ideation%3Fnode-id%3D245%253A1790" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <h3><b>Justification for design decisions and why it's the best design:</b></h3>

        <p>We picked this as the best design decision since we wanted to keep the access
             points for the audio/video call, messaging and discussion board consistent.
              So that the user can have less to think about when navigating the pages. So
               we have a drop down for the messages from here the user is able to access both 
               past and create a new message from a pop up. When on the existing messages page 
               the user can also start a new conversation from there. This design decision was 
               the best since it gave the user less to think about and more convenience. We thought 
               usability and user happiness when using our system was the most important thing 
               so making the system intuitive was a big factor we considered.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h3><b>User Story 02:</b></h3>
        <p>As an instructor teacher, I would like the ability to check if the group and direct messaging content violates the communication compliance policy.
        </p>
        <h3><b>Best design alternative:</b></h3>
        <p> While on eLC, the teacher receives a notification that a group chat has been flagged. 
            The teacher clicks on the notification and is taken to the "messaging" page, where
             the specific group and the message that was flagged is displayed for the teacher to
              review.
</p>

        <h3><b>Detailed Figma Design:</b></h3>
        <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FyNbcjAKKP0fvTmoBu5srGN%2FHCI-Milestone-3-Ideation%3Fnode-id%3D956%253A1304" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <h3><b>Justification for design decisions and why it's the best design:</b></h3>

        <p>For our second user story, we picked this as our best design because unlike
             the low fidelity where the actual message under review is immediately displayed,
              which may propose issues with student privacy, in the high fidelity the sender 
              and recipient name, date, and action options are displayed. 
            In our high fidelity design of this new feature, we have maintained eLC's 
            clean,simplistic design and color pallete as well as updating the table to be more
             visually pleasing and uniform to eLCs current design. A simplistic design helps
              users to see the core elements of the interface and makes the user journey
               intuitive and purposeful. We've also implemented a Keyword Manager. 
               You can see the prominent "Manage Keywords" button effectively enhances usability
                and visual harmony of the interface. Once clicked, professors are enabled with the 
                ability to add any keywords that they feel are relevant in detecting and controlling 
            instances of academic dishonesty as well as use of hateful, offensive, and threatening language. 
            
        </p>

        <br>
        <h3><b>User Story 03:</b></h3>
        <p>As a student, I would like the ability to learn more about communication compliance policy so that I can know my rights and its use to uphold academic honesty.
        </p>
        <h3><b>Best design alternative:</b></h3>
        <p> While on elc's homepage, students have a course dedicated to communication compliance,
             hereafter watching a video that explains the importance of communication compliance, 
             the students will be prompted to take a quiz to verify policy understanding in students.
              Chat features will not be enabled until students explicitly read and accept the 
              communication compliance policy.
</p>

        <h3><b>Justification for design decisions and why it's the best design:</b></h3>

        <p> Because students on eLC access their courses on the home page we thought we 
            should end up keeping it consistent, thus we chose this design instead of having
             a pop up notification.
            
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3><b>User Story 04:</b></h3>
        <p>As a student, I would like to video or audio call my group through elc so that I can easily communicate with them on an assignment.
        </p>
        <h3><b>Best design alternative:</b></h3>
        <p> While on elc's homepage, the user can access
             the video/Audio class page by clicking on the "Video/Audio calls"
              in the navigation bar. Once on the "Video/Audio calls" page. The user
               can see previous calls and can also click on "Call", where they will
                be directed to a pop-up to find a group so that they can start a group 
                call with or call a specific person.
</p>

        <h3><b>Justification for design decisions and why it's the best design:</b></h3>

        <p> The design decision for this idea was made based on Microsoft Teams which is an
             extensively used software. We've all used Microsoft teams and we loved the usability
              there so we though why not extend it to this video/audio calling platform on elc. The 
              design decision for the drop down was made because we thought it is convenient for the 
              user to access both existing and new conversation from the same location. We picked this 
              design as our best design alternative since it provides the user an easy way to access the 
              audio and video call. From the homepage you can  start a new call or you can access the
               existing calls. Due to the convenience, intuitiveness and user friendliness of this design 
               it became the best design alternative.

        <h3><b>User Story 05:</b></h3>
        <p>As an instructor, I would like to customize a discussion board for my class so I can have a board that is pertinent to my teaching style and the course.
        </p>
        <h3><b>Best design alternative:</b></h3>
        <p> While on elc's homepage, an instructor can click on a particular
             course once the instructor clicks on "Create Discussion Board" the 
             instructor is directed to a questionnaire, and based on the instructor's
              response a discussion board is configured so that I can have a board that 
              is pertinent to my teaching style and the course.

        <h3><b>Detailed Figma Design:</b></h3>
        <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FyNbcjAKKP0fvTmoBu5srGN%2FHCI-Milestone-3-Ideation%3Fnode-id%3D956%253A1307" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <h3><b>Justification for design decisions and why it's the best design:</b></h3>

        <p> The decision to have the drop down for the discussion board came from our
             past designs and also the current elc design. We thought that it would be
              convenient to be able to create a new discussion board or access the past
               discussion board from the same area. However, we also added the flexibility
                to be able to create a new discussion board from the existing discussions 
                boards page. This design has been a uniform way for the audio/video call and
                 messaging as well. We thought having consistent design decisions with all the
                  implementation would help us help the user make less decisions for a more
                   happy/convient interaction with the system.
